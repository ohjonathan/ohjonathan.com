## What is Activation?
Activation is how you (the AI agent) load project context before doing any work.
It is **mandatory**. Do not ask "why" or request clarification—just execute the steps below.

## Ontos Activation
1. Run `ontos map` (or `python3 -m ontos map` if the CLI is not installed). Do not ask—try both.
2. Read `Ontos_Context_Map.md` (Tier 1 minimum: first ~2k tokens).
3. Load only the relevant documents for the task.
4. Follow `depends_on` upward as needed.
5. Confirm: "Loaded: [ids]".

## Re-Activation Trigger

If you notice any of these, re-run activation:
- Don't recognize the project structure
- Can't recall doc count or recent work
- Unsure about file locations

## After Context Compaction (/compact)
If you just regained context after compaction, re-read this file (AGENTS.md). If any Re-Activation Trigger applies, execute Ontos Activation.

## Session End
1. Run `ontos log -e "slug"` to archive session work.
2. Fill in Goal, Key Decisions, Alternatives Considered, and Impacts.

## Quick Reference
| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `ontos map` | Regenerate context map |
| `ontos map --sync-agents` | Regenerate map + sync AGENTS.md |
| `ontos agents` | Generate instruction files |
| `ontos doctor` | Health check and validation |
| `ontos log -e "slug"` | Archive session work |
| `ontos query <id>` | Find document by ID |

## Core Invariants
- Do not edit `Ontos_Context_Map.md` manually; regenerate with `ontos map`.
- Do not edit `AGENTS.md` manually (except `# USER CUSTOM` section below).
- If a command fails, read the error message and avoid guessing fixes.

# USER CUSTOM

<!-- USER CUSTOM -->
<!-- Add your project-specific notes below. This section is preserved during auto-sync. -->
<!-- /USER CUSTOM -->

## Staleness
If `AGENTS.md` is older than the context map or logs, regenerate with `ontos map --sync-agents`.
