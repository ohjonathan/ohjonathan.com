## Projects

### Enterprise GenAI Knowledge Platform
**Founding Engagement Manager (Client-Deployed)**
**Confidential · McKinsey & Company · Jan 2025 – July 2025**

- Turned billions of dollars of static consulting deliverables into a living, AI-powered knowledge system; built and deployed the platform across 3 client sites (semiconductor, HVAC, steel) as sole business lead from inception
- Drove end-to-end implementation at each client site, redesigning how teams surface, synthesize, and build on prior strategic work — from knowledge graph architecture to executive rollout
- Scaled from founding team to 40–50 person cross-region operation (US, Europe, India); owned product direction and governance; transitioned platform to a dedicated team of 5+ PMs and multiple consultants for continued development

### Project Ontos
**Creator, AI Context Management System**
**Open Source · Solo-built · PyPI: ontos · Apache 2.0**

- Solved the context portability problem across AI tools — built a repo-native knowledge graph in markdown + YAML that makes decisions inspectable, repeatable, and durable across sessions and rewrites
- Designed a structural graph traversal system with layered context (kernel → strategy → product → atom), ensuring strategic rationale survives when implementation is rewritten
- Published on PyPI as a Python CLI; used in daily production workflows; 500+ commits; roadmap to MCP integration

## Experience

### McKinsey & Company — Engagement Manager
**McKinsey Technology · December 2021 – Present**

- Re-evaluated a ~$35M/year ERP contract and developed a GenAI and data strategy for a Canadian oil & gas company, unlocking siloed data capabilities and building an enterprise AI roadmap; CIO presented findings to the board, expanding into follow-on work
- Redesigned the technology operating model for a federal financial agency, consolidating 10+ business units and 150+ senior engineering leaders under a new horizontal governance structure across previously siloed branches
- Drove ~$30M in incremental annual savings across a ~$2B infrastructure budget through compute scheduling optimization, consumption-based contract renegotiation, hardware resale, and contractor consolidation
